Run main program:
	mpirun -np NTASKS salesman.exe INFILE SEED
	NTASKS is the amount of processes to run
	INFILE is the file used for input. See 20cities.dat for format.
	SEED is the optional seed to use, defaulting to random seed.

Example output in example.txt and route.tsv. route.tsv is simply the vertices in the order the route visits them.
This output is generated with:
	mpirun -np 4 salesman.exe 20cities.dat 1


Run test program:
	mpirun -np N_TASKS test.exe NVERTEX SEED
	NTASKS and SEED as above.
	NVERTEX is the amount of vertices on a circle to generate.

The output of the test program is just the length of the route calculated and amount of generations it took to find, seperated by a tab.
The files 'out_NTASKS_NVERTEX.tsv' each contain a hundred runs of the test program with random seeds, generated by 'test_n.sh' and 'test_procs.sh'. 
To run those:
	./test_n.sh
	./test_procs.sh


Finally, 'test_n.py' and 'test_procs.py' are used to generate the plots in the .pdf file.
